# C - Hash tables

## Description
This project introduces the concept of **hash tables**, a powerful data structure that allows fast data retrieval.  
You will implement basic operations such as creating a hash table, storing key/value pairs, retrieving values, printing the table, and deleting it.

By completing this project, you will understand how hash tables work internally and why they are widely used in many programming languages—such as Python dictionaries.
